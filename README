This is a Pit Game Board application
==========================================

RUN
-------
The application is made and is run with the help of Applet
The Main class from which applet is run is PitBoard.java

If you are importing the project in Editor you can directly run PitBoard.java as a JavaApplication

From out side you have to do a javac PitBoard.java
and then appletviewer PitBoard.java

Extension
==========================================
The project while working on it i wanted to extend it as a web-service application.
So thats why BoardApplication.java class is present.
Although right now it can only run as a simple java application where you can give command line request.

If this seems an overhead or otherwise, it can be ignored or removed entirely.
